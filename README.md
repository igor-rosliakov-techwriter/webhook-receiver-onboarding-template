# Webhook Receiver Onboarding Template

This repository is a portfolio project focused on backend onboarding documentation.

It uses a webhook receiver as an example service to demonstrate how onboarding guides,
architecture documentation, runbooks, and ADRs can be structured in a real-world backend team.

The code is intentionally minimal and exists to support the documentation,
not to represent a production-ready system.
