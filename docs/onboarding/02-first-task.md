# First task: add a new event type

Goal: implement handling for a new webhook event type and add a sample payload.

(TBD) Steps will include:
- adding a new payload under `examples/payloads/`
- adding a handler function in `src/`
- registering it in the event dispatcher
- updating docs and example responses
